I am a cloud engineer specializing in AWS infrastructure and DevOps automation. I design and build scalable cloud platforms using infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines. My work focuses on enabling teams to deploy applications securely and efficiently while maintaining high operational standards.

I have hands-on experience with AWS services (ECS, Lambda, S3, VPC), Terraform for infrastructure management, Docker for containerization, and GitLab CI/CD for automation. I'm passionate about open source, security best practices, and helping teams adopt cloud-native approaches.

Before transitioning to cloud engineering, I spent 10 years as a research scientist 🧑‍🔬 developing data processing systems and computational workflows, which gave me strong foundations in systematic problem-solving and data pipeline design.

## A bit more about me

My technical journey started in scientific computing where I built data processing pipelines for large-scale oceanographic datasets. This experience taught me the importance of reproducible workflows, systematic documentation, and robust data systems—all of which translate directly to cloud infrastructure work.

I hold a Master of Science in Ocean and Atmosphere Physics from La Sorbonne University in Paris and a PhD in Physical Oceanography from Université de Perpignan Via Domitia (France)

I have always been interested in using technology to solve interesting data problems. After completing my PhD and a postdoctoral experience at CNRS and LOCEAN in Paris, I moved to Scotland where I worked at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, working at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton UK. In my research, I developed and managed data processing workflows for ocean observation programmes, including underwater buoy arrays and underwater glider surveys. I also developed statistical methods to quantify ocean current strength and understand climate impacts.

I built scientific libraries to process observational data from 🤖, 🚢 & 🛰️ and authored 30+ scientific articles 📄 published in peer-reviewed journals. I presented my work at 60+ international conferences 🗣️ (12 as invited speaker).

During those years, I spent 200+ days at sea 🌊 in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean 🌍, planning and co-leading fieldwork activities across 12 oceanographic research cruises.

In 2021, I transitioned to software engineering, joining OSE Engineering as an R&D Software Engineer. I worked on Python libraries and full-stack development projects, taking responsibility for repository maintenance, code structure, documentation, and tutorials.

In November 2022, I joined the Department for Work and Pensions - Digital as a Software Engineer, developing cloud-based AI solutions for document processing and classification. In August 2023, I was promoted to Senior Cyber Platform Engineer, where I now focus on building secure, scalable platforms for AI workloads while mentoring junior engineers and improving team capabilities.
