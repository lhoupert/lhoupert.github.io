I am a software engineer with experience in cloud infrastructure and container platform development, who thrives in solving problems and creating capabilities for my team and organisation. I strongly believe in automation, security-first approaches, and improving team ways of working to deliver better software more effectively.

I have worked with various technologies (Python, Docker, AWS, Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, container security), but the people I work with and the problems I tackle are more important to me than any specific technology.

I started my career working 10 years as a research scientist üßë‚Äçüî¨ where I developed methods to turn raw oceanographic data into meaningful scientific insights, spending 200+ days at sea conducting research.

I have a strong interest in data systems, cloud-native technologies, and AI platforms. I am skilled in problem-solving, systematic analysis, and I love working with open source tools, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my software engineering craft.

## A bit more about me

I hold a Master of Science in Ocean and Atmosphere Physics from La Sorbonne Universoty in Paris and a PhD in Physical Oceanography from Universit√© de Perpignan Via Domitia (France)

I have always been interested in using technology to solve interesting data problems. After completing my PhD and a postdoctoral experience at CNRS and LOCEAN in Paris, I moved to Scotland where I worked at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, working at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton UK. In my research, I developed and managed data processing workflows for ocean observation programmes, including underwater buoy arrays and underwater glider surveys. I also developed statistical methods to quantify ocean current strength and understand climate impacts.

I built scientific libraries to process observational data from ü§ñ, üö¢ & üõ∞Ô∏è and authored 30+ scientific articles üìÑ published in peer-reviewed journals. I presented my work at 60+ international conferences üó£Ô∏è (12 as invited speaker).

During those years, I spent 200+ days at sea üåä in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean üåç, planning and co-leading fieldwork activities across 12 oceanographic research cruises.

In 2021, I transitioned to software engineering, joining OSE Engineering as an R&D Software Engineer. I worked on Python libraries and full-stack development projects, taking responsibility for repository maintenance, code structure, documentation, and tutorials.

In November 2022, I joined the Department for Work and Pensions - Digital as a Software Engineer, developing cloud-based AI solutions for document processing and classification. In August 2023, I was promoted to Senior Cyber Platform Engineer, where I now focus on building secure, scalable platforms for AI workloads while mentoring junior engineers and improving team capabilities.



## Technical Philosophy

My approach tries to combine scientific rigor with pragmatic engineering:

- **Systematic Analysis**: Applying research-trained approaches to break down complex problems
- **Documentation-First**: Writing comprehensive technical documentation, inspired by scientific publishing practices
- **Iterative Improvement**: Using hypothesis-driven development and evidence-based optimization
- **Collaborative Learning**: Drawing from international research experience to support engineering teams
