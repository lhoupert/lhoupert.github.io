description: "From ocean depths to orbital views: learning cloud-native geospatial engineering in public"
---

Welcome to my new blog! I plan to document here my learning journey as a Cloud Engineer at Development Seed, working on cloud-native geospatial pipelines and AI-driven tools for Earth observation. Beyond documenting my own learning, I hope these posts will help others exploring the intersection of scientific computing, geospatial technologies, and modern cloud infrastructure.
My background spans oceanographic research, platform engineering, and cloud infrastructure.

## What I am planning to Write About:

- **Learning in Public**: Building expertise in STAC, Zarr, Kubernetes, and AI orchestration for geospatial systems

- **Geospatial Technologies**: Cloud-native formats, Python libraries, and infrastructure for Earth observation

- **Open Source Journey**: Contributing to community projects and participating in standards development

- **Career Evolution**: Navigating transitions from scientific computing to cloud-native engineering
