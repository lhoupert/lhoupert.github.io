### 📈 **Skills Development Journey**

When I reflect on my career path, it feels less like a straight line and more like stepping stones across different domains. Each phase built upon the previous one, though I certainly didn't plan it this way from the beginning. What started as curiosity about ocean currents somehow led me to container orchestration - and looking back, the connections make more sense than they did at the time.

### 🐍 **Python Development Experience**

Python became my main language almost by accident - I needed better tools for analyzing massive oceanographic datasets, and Python's scientific ecosystem was irresistible. What started as data wrangling gradually expanded into web applications, cloud automation, and now platform engineering. I've found that each domain taught me something different about writing maintainable, reliable code.

#### **Core Development**
- **Language Experience**: 5+ years, procedural, OOP
- **Modern Tooling**: `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, pre-commit hooks
- **Web Frameworks**: Flask, Django

#### **Data & Scientific Computing**
- **Analysis Stack**: NumPy, Pandas, Xarray (large datasets)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Cartopy (geospatial)
- **ML/Stats**: scikit-learn, statistical modeling, Monte Carlo methods

#### **Infrastructure Integration**
- **AWS SDKs**: boto3, CDK constructs, Lambda functions
- **Documentation**: Sphinx, MkDocs, automated API docs
- **Testing**: pytest, integration testing, mocking strategies

### 🔄 **DevOps & Automation Experience**

I discovered DevOps practices out of necessity - managing research data across multiple environments taught me that manual processes don't scale, and inconsistency often leads to problems. Now I find myself gravitating toward automation not just for efficiency and repeatability but because it forces clarity in thinking. _"If you can't automate it, you probably don't understand it well enough yet."_


| Domain | Tools & Approaches | Recent Focus |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **CI/CD** | GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Conventional Commits | Automated versioning |
| **IaC** | Terraform, AWS CDK, Configuration Management | Multi-env modules |
| **Security** | SAST/DAST, Container Scanning, Policy as Code | Zero-CVE containers |

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure & Platform Layer**

My experience with cloud infrastructure has taught me to appreciate both the technical challenges of system design and the practical impact these systems have on development teams. Each component serves a specific purpose, and the real value emerges when they work together effectively to solve actual problems.

### 🐳 **Containerization & Security Stack**

Container security emerged as a natural extension of my infrastructure work when I began focusing on platform reliability and team productivity. Working with zero-CVE approaches like Chainguard images has shown me that security practices can actually simplify operations - fewer vulnerabilities mean less time spent on patches and more predictable deployment cycles.

### 🎯 **Core Competencies**

The diagram below shows how I understand my professional development, with **Problem Solving** as the driving force - that curiosity about "how can we make this work better?" that excites me in any role, from analyzing ocean currents to building container platforms.

The three branches reflect my career evolution: **Scientific Thinking** from research years where you learn to be systematic and question everything, **Engineering Practices** developed transitioning to software development, and **Team Leadership** emerging as I found sharing knowledge often more impactful than individual work. These areas reinforce each other - my research background helps me approach infrastructure methodically, engineering experience makes me a better mentor, and team work drives more systematic thinking.

The **Continuous Learning** foundation feels essential - every role change, technology, or colleague conversation adds to this framework. It's how I approach growth: staying curious, building on what I know, and helping others grow too.
