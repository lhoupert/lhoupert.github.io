I'm a cloud engineer specializing in AWS infrastructure, containerization, and DevOps automation. 

I build secure, scalable cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines that enable teams to deploy and manage applications efficiently. Currently focused on infrastructure-as-code, container orchestration, and helping organizations adopt cloud-native practices.
