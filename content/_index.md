<br>
I'm a cloud engineer specializing in geospatial data infrastructure, containerization, and DevOps automation. 

Currently at Development Seed, I build cloud-native platforms and data pipelines for Earth observation systems, working with organizations like ESA and NASA. I focus on scalable infrastructure-as-code, container orchestration, and helping teams process and analyze massive geospatial datasets efficiently.

Previously, I spent a decade as a research scientist developing data processing systems for oceanographic observations, giving me deep expertise in large-scale scientific data workflows.
