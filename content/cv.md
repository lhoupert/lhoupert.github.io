My technical journey began in marine physics research, where I spent over a decade learning computational methods for oceanographic data analysis. This foundation in scientific computing and systematic problem-solving gradually evolved toward software engineering and cloud infrastructure, ultimately leading to my current work building geospatial data platforms for Earth observation.
