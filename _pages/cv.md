#### Employment

##### 2023-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Senior Cyber Platform Engineer, *[Department for Work and Pensions - Digital](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/about/){:target="_blank"}, Newcastle*

+ Engineering Cloud Native Data Science platforms at the Cyber Resilience Centre


##### 2022-2023, Software Engineer, *[Department for Work and Pensions - Digital](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/about/){:target="_blank"}, Newcastle*

+ Develop a cloud-based software as part of an Agile team to get insights from the multiple handwritten letters sent to DWP services. I contributed to the development of the AI component of the solution by building a test dataset and optimizing the labels and thresholds used by our zero shot classification model (https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli). I also supported the team in deploying the solution on Sagemaker using AWS Cloud Development Toolkit.

+ Develop serverless services (AWS lambda function) with AWS CDK using Python and TypeScript

##### 2021-2022, R&D Software Developer, *[OSE Engineering](http://ose-engineering.fr/){:target="_blank"}, France*
+ Lead the development of the front-end (JavaScript) and back-end (Django) of a Web application to manage a fleet of delivery robots. 
Some of the functionalities include: 1) mission design using cytoscape.js, 2) control the robot using WebSocket, 3) remote control 
using joystick and data/video streaming using WebRTC.
+ Develop a python package (source code, docs, example notebooks) to solve the electric vehicle routing problem using a
Dijkstra's algorithm and interactive maps visualisation using Folium/Leaflet.js
+ Initiate a guide for python software development best practices internal to the company. The guide covers topics such as how to structure a python project, writing meaningful code, documentation, testing strategy, or continuous integration.

##### 2019-2021, Research Scientist, *[National Oceanography Centre](https://noc.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, Southampton*

Characterisation of the variability of North Atlantic circulation from ocean observations
+ Planned, executed and led fieldwork (transatlantic research cruises, robotic missions)
+ Developed reproducible workflow for the data processing of robotic data with the development of a matlab toolbox.
+ Designed new methods to characterise the ocean heat transport from new observations (gridding of irregular datasets, objective mapping, spectral analysis, Monte Carlo)
+ Led and published reports and research articles on the data obtained from field programmes

##### 2013–2014, Postdoctoral Associate, *[LOCEAN](https://www.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr){:target="_blank"}, Paris*
Characterisation of the spatio-temporal scales relevant for the winter mixing of the ocean
+ Identified principal mode of variability of ocean currents using dimension reduction methods.
+ Detection of coherent eddy patterns in time-series using wavelett analysis.

##### 2010–2013, PhD Fellow in Ocean Physics, *[CEFREM](https://cefrem.univ-perp.fr/){:target="_blank"}, Perpignan*
Analysis of multi-platform observations to study of the impact of episodic events (storm and winter mixing) 
on the ocean circulation and the long-term evolution of its properties
+ Data gathering, cleaning and exploration of oceanic profiles (>200k), including quality control procedures 
(cross-calibration,outliers), metadata collection and descriptive statistics
+ Analysed spatio-temporal variability of ocean mixing (covariance and time-series analysis)
+ Identified spatial regions with similar seasonal cycle using a k-mean cluster analysis

#### Experience in Software Development
+ regular (and efficient) communication with co-worker and customers
+ good understanding of the project requirements, and if necessary, helping the customer formulate what he/she wants
+ project management: project planning, prioritizing requirements, and breaking user stories in tasks
+ follow best practices for structuring, designing, and documenting a software project
+ automation: code linter/formatter, source control, testing, and continuous integration pipelines.
  
#### Experience in Python
I mostly use Python as a procedural programming and objected-oriented programming language. I love learning new python patterns 
and write “pythonic” code. For example, when it is suited, I like using assertions, decorators, _args_ and _*kwargs_ parameters, 
NamedTuples and Data Classes, ABC Classes, dictionary, list comprehensions, or generator expressions.

When I am writing code, I follow the [PEP8 guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and software engineering principles from Robert C. Martin’s book [Clean Code](https://github.com/lhoupert/clean-code-python){:target="_blank"}, 
such as writing code that explains itself and is easy to read, writing bug repellent code, follow DRY and SOLID principles and working with design patterns.

I am also documenting the project continuously by creating markdown or reST files and writing docstrings for all the main functions, 
classes and modules developed in the project. Then I use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/){:target="_blank"} to automatically extract docstrings and compiles them into 
a well-structured and easily readable HTML documentation.

I like to use the [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org){:target="_blank"} framework for my unit and functional tests.
