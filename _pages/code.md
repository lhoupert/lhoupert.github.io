*This section is under development...*

You can browse through my current projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/lhoupert).


During my previous position, I worked with the [Extended Ellett Line (EEL)](https://projects.noc.ac.uk/ExtendedEllettLine/) data. You can access the code I used to analyse and visualise the data on my [github repository](https://github.com/lhoupert/analysis_eel_data). You will find some useful bit of code to plot maps using [*cartopy*](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/), hydrographic sections using [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/), or manipulate multi-dimensional array using [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).
