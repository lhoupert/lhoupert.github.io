*This section is under development...*

I recently moved from Matlab to Python. I created a git repository containing
Jupyter notebooks of the python code I am using in my current project.
This code is used to analyse and visualise data from the [Extended Ellett Line (EEL)](https://projects.noc.ac.uk/ExtendedEllettLine/). You can access it on my github [here](https://github.com/lhoupert/analysis_eel_data).

You will find some useful bit of code to plot maps using *cartopy* or hydrographic sections using *matplotlib*. New notebooks using the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package will be added in the near future! *xarray* is a fantastic and powerful to manipulate multi-dimensional array.
