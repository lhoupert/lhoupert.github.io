*This section is under development...*

You can browse through my current projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/lhoupert).


I am currently working on the [Extended Ellett Line (EEL)](https://projects.noc.ac.uk/ExtendedEllettLine/) data. You can access the code I am using to analyse and visualise the data on my [github repository](https://github.com/lhoupert/analysis_eel_data). You will find some useful bit of code to plot maps using [*cartopy*](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) or hydrographic sections using [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/). New notebooks using the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package are under construction. *xarray* is a powerful tool to manipulate multi-dimensional array.
