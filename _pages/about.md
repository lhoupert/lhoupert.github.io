After working 10 years as a research data scientist where I developed methods to turn raw climate data into meaningful scientific information, in 2021 I moved to software engineering and full-stack development. 
I have a strong interest in data, algorithms, and Web technologies. In addition to programming, I am also skilled in problem-solving, data analysis and statistics.
I love working with *open source tools*, new technologies, and learning new skills to improve my *"software craftmanship"*. 


#### A lit bit more about me
I hold a master in atmospheric and oceanic physics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) and a PhD in physical oceanography from Université de Perpignan. 

I have always been interested in using new technologies to solve interesting data problems. After a short postdoctoral experience at the [Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat](https://www.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr) in Paris, I move to Scotland where I worked at the [Scottish Association for Marine Sciences](https://www.sams.ac.uk/) (Oban, UK) as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, at the [National Oceanography Centre](https://noc.ac.uk/) (Southampton, UK). In my research, I developed and led the data processing associated with several ocean observation programmes, such as an array of underwater buoys or repeated hydrological surveys with underwater robots.  In addition, I also developed new physical and statistical methods on these data to quantify the strength of the North Atlantic Current (the eastward extension of the Gulf Stream) in order to understand its impacts on the European and Arctic climate.

In 2021, I started working at [OSE Engineering](http://ose-engineering.fr/){:target="_blank"} as a Research and Development Software Engineer. 
I worked on several python libraries and full-stack development projects. For these prototype projects, I have been the main developer responsible 
for the maintenance of the git repository, structuring of the source code, writing the documentation, and generating tutorials.

In November 2022 I joined  the [Department for Work and Pensions - Digital](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/about/){:target="_blank"} as a Software Engineer. I am working on developping cloud-based Robotic Process Automation.
