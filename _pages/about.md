I am a [1x software engineer](https://1x.engineer/) with experience in back-end software development and infrastructure management, who thrives in solving problems and creating capabilities for my team and my organisation. I strongly believe in automation and improving team ways of working to deliver better, and more effectively.

I have worked with various technologies (Python, Docker, AWS, Terraform, Gitlab CI/CD, Typescript/JavaScript, PostgreSQL), but the people I work with and the problem I tackle are more important to me than a specific technology.

I started my career working 10 years as a research scientist üßëüî¨ where I developed methods to turn raw climate data into meaningful scientific information.

I have a strong interest in data, algorithms, and cloud-native technologies. I am skilled in problem-solving, data analysis and statistics and I love working with *open source tools*, new technologies, and learning new skills to improve my *"software craftmanship"*. 


#### A lit bit more about me
I hold a master in atmospheric and oceanic physics from Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) and a PhD in physical oceanography from Universit√© de Perpignan. 

I have always been interested in using new technologies to solve interesting data problems. After a short postdoctoral experience at the [Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie et du Climat](https://www.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr) in Paris, I move to Scotland where I worked at the [Scottish Association for Marine Sciences](https://www.sams.ac.uk/) (Oban, UK) as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, at the [National Oceanography Centre](https://noc.ac.uk/) (Southampton, UK). In my research, I developed and led the data processing associated with several ocean observation programmes, such as an array of underwater buoys or repeated hydrological surveys with underwater robots.  In addition, I also developed new physical and statistical methods on these data to quantify the strength of the North Atlantic Current (the eastward extension of the Gulf Stream) in order to understand its impacts on the European and Arctic climate.

I developed scientific libraries to process observational data from ü§ñ,  üö¢  &  üõ∞  and turn raw climate data into meaningful scientific information. I authored and co-authored 30+ scientific articles üìÑ published in international peer-review journals. I also had the opportunity to present my work in international and national conferences üó£ (50+ presentations, 12 as invited speaker).

During that time, I also spent 200+ days at sea  üåä  in the North Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea üåç. During these 12 oceanographic cruises, I planned and co-led fieldwork activities by liaising with engineering team and mariners.

In 2021, I started working at [OSE Engineering](http://ose-engineering.fr/){:target="_blank"} as a Research and Development Software Engineer. 
I worked on several python libraries and full-stack development projects. For these prototype projects, I have been the main developer responsible 
for the maintenance of the git repository, structuring of the source code, writing the documentation, and generating tutorials.

In November 2022, I joined  the [Department for Work and Pensions - Digital](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/about/){:target="_blank"} as a Software Engineer where I worked on developping cloud-based automations to process and classify handwritten letters. In August 2023, I have been promoted to Senior Software Engineer and moved to a new team in the Cyber Resilience Centre where I work as Senior Cyber Platform Engineer.
