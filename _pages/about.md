I am a Research Scientist at the [National Oceanography Centre](https://www.noc.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I am using programming, statistics and data analysis to turn ocean and climate data into scientific results.

 I am using a wide range of instruments/tools (ship, underwater robots, satellite, numerical models) to understand modern oceanographic processes and their relationships to climate variability. Currently at the National Oceanography Centre, I am interested in the role of the North Atlantic on the global ocean circulation and the European climate. I am particularly involved in the UK-OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program). I have participated in 11 hydrographic and mooring cruises in the Mediterranean Sea and in the North Atlantic.
