Each phase built upon the previous one, though I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t plan it this way from the beginning. What started as curiosity about ocean currents somehow led me to container orchestration - and looking back, the connections make more sense than they did at the time.\n🌊 RESEARCH ERA 🔄 TRANSITION 🚀 PLATFORM ERA (2010 → 2021) (2021 → 2023) (2023 → Present) ┌─────────────────┐ ┌────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ RESEARCH │ ──▶ │ ENGINEERING │ ──▶│ PLATFORMS │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ • Ocean Data │ │ • Full Stack │ │ • Security │ │ • Statistics │ │ • Cloud APIs │ │ • Containers │ │ • Scientific │ │ • Web Tech │ │ • Team Growth │ │ Writing │ │ • Automation │ │ • End Users │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────┘ └────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ ▼ ▼ ▼ 📊 Scientific Computing 🌐 Web Development 🏗️ Infrastructure \u0026amp; Data Engineering \u0026amp; DevOps \u0026amp; Teams 👥 🐍 Python Development Experience #I transitioned to Python as my primary language in 2020 after extensive work with MATLAB in research.

My experience in academia certainly helped me in developing a strong mentoring culture.\nCurrent Leadership Practice #In my role at DWP, I lead a team of 2 young engineers while supporting broader organizational capability building:\nMentoring Through Action\nRegular pair programming sessions with team members Hands-on debugging sessions that become teaching moments Supporting career progression by creating development plans that balance immediate needs with long-term growth Knowledge Multiplication\nDeveloped comprehensive onboarding guides reducing new developer setup from days to hours Created reusable Terraform modules and Docker templates that encode best practices Established testing strategies that went from concept to 85% coverage implementation Built internal documentation that serves as both reference and learning material Standards Without Rigidity\nImplemented pre-commit hooks and CI/CD standards that guide rather than constrain Introduced code quality metrics that teams actually find helpful Created bug report templates that streamline problem-solving Some Reflections on Technical Leadership #Learning Through Collaboration: Some of my most valuable moments happen when working alongside my teammates on challenging problems. Those debugging sessions often become mutual learning experiences where we both discover better approaches to error handling and system design.\nFreedom Through Structure: I\u0026rsquo;ve found it interesting how clear technical guidelines can actually increase creativity. When the team doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about formatting or basic quality checks, I think it create more mental space to focus on solving the actual problems at hand.\nFrom Solving to Enabling: I\u0026rsquo;m gradually shifting from \u0026ldquo;I know how to fix this\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How can we build systems so this problem becomes easier for everyone to solve?\u0026rdquo; When I built that Docker Compose environment to allow the team to run integration tests between our web application, graph database, and splunk server, it didn\u0026rsquo;t just solve an immediate problem, it remove a recurring blocker for everyone.\nCurrent Focus Areas # Cognitive Load Reduction: Actively working to reduce the mental overhead for developers through better tooling and clearer abstractions Sustainable Pace: Advocating for realistic timelines and technical debt management Cross-Team Collaboration: Building bridges between platform, security, and data science teams through shared understanding and common tools 🎯 Core Competencies #The diagram below shows how I understand my professional development, with Problem Solving as \u0026ldquo;the driving force\u0026rdquo;.\nThe three branches reflect my career evolution: Scientific Thinking from research years where you learn to be systematic and question everything, Engineering Practices developed transitioning to software development, and Team Leadership emerging as I found sharing knowledge often more impactful than individual work. These areas reinforce each other: my research background helps me approach infrastructure methodically, engineering experience makes me a better mentor, and team work drives more systematic thinking.\nThe Continuous Learning foundation feels essential: every role change, technology, or colleague conversation adds to this framework. It\u0026rsquo;s how I approach growth: staying curious, building on what I know, and helping others grow too.\n┌─────────────────┐ │ PROBLEM │ │ SOLVING │ └─────────────────┘ │ ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌───────▼──────┐ ┌───────▼───────┐ ┌──────▼──────┐ │ SCIENTIFIC │────▶│ ENGINEERING │────▶│ TEAM │ │ THINKING │ │ PRACTICES │ │ LEADERSHIP │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ • Systematic │ │ • Automation │ │ • Mentoring │ │ • Rigorous │ │ • Security │ │ • Pairing │ │ • Data-Driven│ │ • Scalability │ │ • Standards │ └──────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └─────────────┘ ▲ ▲ ▲ └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘ │ ┌───────┴───────┐ │ CONTINUOUS │ │ LEARNING │ └───────────────┘ ","date":"15 June 2025","permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/skills/","section":"Loïc Houpert","summary":"","title":"My Technical Evolution"},{"content":"My technical journey began in marine physics research, where I spent over a decade learning computational methods for oceanographic data analysis.

I strongly believe in automation, security-first approaches, and improving team ways of working to deliver better software more effectively.\nI have worked with various technologies (Python, Docker, AWS, Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, container security), but the people I work with and the problems I tackle are more important to me than any specific technology.\nI started my career working 10 years as a research scientist 🧑‍🔬 where I developed methods to turn raw oceanographic data into meaningful scientific insights, spending 200+ days at sea conducting research.\nI have a strong interest in data systems, cloud-native technologies, and AI platforms. I am skilled in problem-solving, systematic analysis, and I love working with open source tools, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my software engineering craft.\nA bit more about me #I hold a Master of Science in Ocean and Atmosphere Physics from La Sorbonne University in Paris and a PhD in Physical Oceanography from Université de Perpignan Via Domitia (France)\nI have always been interested in using technology to solve interesting data problems. After completing my PhD and a postdoctoral experience at CNRS and LOCEAN in Paris, I moved to Scotland where I worked at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, working at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton UK. In my research, I developed and managed data processing workflows for ocean observation programmes, including underwater buoy arrays and underwater glider surveys. I also developed statistical methods to quantify ocean current strength and understand climate impacts.\nI built scientific libraries to process observational data from 🤖, 🚢 \u0026amp; 🛰️ and authored 30+ scientific articles 📄 published in peer-reviewed journals. I presented my work at 60+ international conferences 🗣️ (12 as invited speaker).\nDuring those years, I spent 200+ days at sea 🌊 in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean 🌍, planning and co-leading fieldwork activities across 12 oceanographic research cruises.\nIn 2021, I transitioned to software engineering, joining OSE Engineering as an R\u0026amp;D Software Engineer. I worked on Python libraries and full-stack development projects, taking responsibility for repository maintenance, code structure, documentation, and tutorials.\nIn November 2022, I joined the Department for Work and Pensions - Digital as a Software Engineer, developing cloud-based AI solutions for document processing and classification. In August 2023, I was promoted to Senior Cyber Platform Engineer, where I now focus on building secure, scalable platforms for AI workloads while mentoring junior engineers and improving team capabilities.\n","date":"1 June 2025","permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/about/","section":"Loïc Houpert","summary":"","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
