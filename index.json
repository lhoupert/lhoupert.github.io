Currently at Development Seed, I design and build scalable cloud platforms for Earth observation data, enabling organizations like ESA, and ECMWF to process and analyze massive geospatial datasets efficiently.\nI have hands-on experience with AWS services (ECS, Lambda, S3, VPC), Terraform and CDK for infrastructure management, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization, and comprehensive CI/CD automation. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about open source, security best practices, and helping teams adopt cloud-native approaches for scientific data processing.\nMy Journey from Ocean Data to Earth Observation #Before transitioning to cloud engineering, I spent 10 years as a research scientist 🧑‍🔬 developing data processing systems and computational workflows for oceanographic observations. This experience gave me strong foundations in systematic problem-solving, large-scale data pipeline design, and working with scientific data formats.\nMy technical journey started in scientific computing where I built data processing pipelines for large-scale oceanographic datasets collected from underwater buoys, research vessels, and satellite observations. I developed statistical methods to analyze time-series data and geospatial datasets, implemented quality control procedures for sensor networks, and created reproducible workflows.\nThis experience taught me the importance of robust data systems, systematic documentation, and reliable processing pipelines. All of these are essential skills for building cloud infrastructure that scientists and analysts depend on daily.\nAcademic Background \u0026amp; Research Experience #I hold a Master of Science in Ocean and Atmosphere Physics from La Sorbonne University in Paris and a PhD in Physical Oceanography from Université de Perpignan Via Domitia (France)\nI have always been interested in using technology to solve interesting data problems. After completing my PhD and a postdoctoral experience at CNRS and LOCEAN in Paris, I moved to Scotland where I worked at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban as a research scientist for 4 years. Then I moved to England, working at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton UK.\nIn my research, I developed and managed data processing workflows for ocean observation programmes, including underwater buoy arrays and underwater glider surveys. I also developed statistical methods to quantify ocean current strength and understand climate impacts. I built scientific libraries to process observational data from 🤖, 🚢 \u0026amp; 🛰️ and authored 30+ scientific articles 📄 published in peer-reviewed journals. I presented my work at 60+ international conferences 🗣️ (12 as invited speaker).\nDuring those years, I spent 200+ days at sea 🌊 in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean 🌍, planning and co-leading fieldwork activities across 12 oceanographic research cruises.\nTransition to Software Engineering \u0026amp; Cloud Infrastructure #In 2021, I transitioned to software engineering, joining OSE Engineering as an R\u0026amp;D Software Engineer. I worked on Python libraries and full-stack development projects, taking responsibility for repository maintenance, code structure, documentation, and tutorials.\nIn November 2022, I joined the Department for Work and Pensions - Digital as a Software Engineer, developing cloud-based AI solutions for document processing and classification. In August 2023, I was promoted to Senior Cyber Platform Engineer, where I now focus on building secure, scalable platforms for AI workloads while mentoring junior engineers and improving team capabilities.\nNow at Development Seed, I combine my scientific data processing background with modern cloud engineering practices to build infrastructure that enables Earth observation science at scale.\n","date":"13 November 2025","permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/about/","section":"Loïc Houpert","summary":"","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/tags/announcement/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Announcement"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/tags/career/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Career"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/tags/development-seed/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Development-Seed"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/tags/earth-observation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Earth-Observation"},{"content":" 🌊 → 💻 → 🚀 → 🛰️ #From Ocean Depths to Earth Observation #A transformative journey through data, code, and human connection\n🎭 Act I: The Ocean Years 2010 → 2021 # 🌊 The Deep Dive Chronicles # 🔬 The Data Archaeologist 2014 → 2018\nScottish Association for Marine Science | Scotland\n\u0026ldquo;In the depths of the North Atlantic, I learned that the most complex systems require the simplest, most elegant solutions.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Mission: Decode the ocean\u0026rsquo;s secrets through robotic observations\nThe Challenge: 200+ days at sea, 12 research cruises, untamed data\nThe Discovery: System design thinking emerges from chaos\nThe Legacy: MATLAB toolboxes that still process ocean data today\nSkills Forged: 🎯 Project leadership • 🔍 System design • 🤝 Collaboration\n📊 The Pattern Hunter 2019 → 2021\nNational Oceanography Centre | Southampton\n\u0026ldquo;In 200,000+ climate observations, I found that statistical truth emerges through systematic methodology.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Quest: Quantify uncertainty in massive climate datasets\nThe Method: Monte Carlo simulations meet oceanographic reality\nThe Impact: Mentoring the next generation of computational scientists\nThe Insight: Reproducible workflows are the foundation of trust\nSkills Evolved: 📈 Statistical modeling • 🔄 Reproducible workflows • 🎓 Mentoring\n🦋 Act II: The Metamorphosis 2021 → 2023 # 🔄 The Great Transformation # 🔧 The Code Alchemist 2021 → 2022\nOSE Engineering | France\n\u0026ldquo;Where I learned that robot fleets and ocean buoys both need elegant orchestration.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Pivot: From MATLAB to Python, from papers to products\nThe Reality: Full-stack development meets delivery optimization\nThe Growth: WebSocket real-time systems, routing algorithms\nThe Foundation: Agile methodologies, product-focused engineering\nNew Powers: 🐍 Python mastery • 🔗 Real-time systems • 📦 Product delivery\n🤖 The AI Architect 2022 → 2023\nDepartment for Work and Pensions | Newcastle\n\u0026ldquo;Government scale taught me that technical excellence must serve human needs.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Mission: Document processing AI for public service\nThe Stack: AWS SageMaker, serverless architectures, TypeScript\nThe Learning: Regulated environments, compliance, coding standards\nThe Revelation: Technology\u0026rsquo;s true purpose is human empowerment\nPowers Enhanced: ☁️ Cloud architecture • 🤖 AI/ML systems • 📋 Compliance\n🚀 Act III: The Platform Era 2023 → 2025 # 🏗️ The Platform Builder # 🛡️ The Infrastructure Guardian 2023 → Present\nDepartment for Work and Pensions -

On top of that, I am very thrilled about Development Seed\u0026rsquo;s approach to building open-source solutions by default!\nFrom Ocean Observations to Cloud Engineering #My path into Earth observation data has been a bit unusual. I started by collecting oceanographic measurements at sea; I spent more than 200 days on research vessels where we used various instruments to measure ocean physical parameters such as temperature, salinity, and velocity. I also used a lot of underwater gliders: autonomous, propeller-less robots that use changes in buoyancy and wings to move through the water column and collect oceanographic data. Their multi-month operational autonomy allows coverage of remote areas, supports long-term monitoring, and allows for consistent measurements across vast distances.\nMy observationalist work involved integrating these observations with other sources of climate data such as satellite observations and ocean models, developing quality control workflows for these multi-platform observations, implementing statistical and physics-based analysis methods for spatial variability studies, and publishing my results in scientific articles.\nSchematic of the most common type of measurement techniques used by oceanographers to observe the oceans. Source: Marine Copernicus In 2021, after more than a decade in academic research, I decided to leave my research career to take a research engineer position at OSE Engineering, a fully remote role. One of the main reasons why I decided to quit academia is that I became increasingly curious about the engineering challenges behind the data systems I used regularly. As a researcher, I relied on these systems for oceanographic analysis, but I wanted to understand how they actually work from the inside: how data services handle performance issues, how infrastructure is managed when systems fail. When processing pipelines encountered problems or performed poorly, I wanted to understand why and learn how to fix them rather than just reporting issues.\nThis shift required learning backend development, system architecture, and software engineering best practices. Over the past 4 years, I have built Python-based backend systems and co-managed AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The technical stack I used evolved significantly since my researcher days! I went from MATLAB scientific computing to production-grade Python services and from research-focused workflows to scalable cloud architectures. My expertise also broadened significantly, evolving from single-domain expertise to cross-functional engineering approaches.\nComing Full Circle #Now I am back in the field of Earth observation! This time I will be working with satellite data and geospatial services from an engineering and product perspective, rather than a user perspective. At Development Seed, I will be combining scientific domain knowledge with cloud infrastructure expertise to make Earth observation data more accessible through modern engineering practices. I will work with partners such as the European Space Agency and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. My background in Earth system physics, environmental data collection, and cloud-native engineering all come together in this role! I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be well-prepared for the technical challenges ahead.\nRange of ESA satellites used for Earth observation missions. Source: ESA Why Development Seed and These Projects #While I was going through the interview process, I discovered the vast range of Development Seed projects and I was very impressed by both their diversity and their depth! It really matches the kind of projects I would like to contribute to. Here are some examples of such projects:\nGlobal Nature Watch #Global Nature Watch is \u0026ldquo;an open, AI-powered system that transforms groundbreaking land monitoring data into intelligence to understand Earth\u0026rsquo;s landscapes\u0026rdquo;. The platform combines 80+ peer-reviewed datasets into a conversational AI interface that makes environmental intelligence accessible across 170 languages. The technical approach uses AI for orchestration rather than content generation which ensures reliable, reproducible outputs grounded in peer-reviewed science. Indigenous communities in the Philippines are using this technology to defend ancestral territories, and Brazilian cooperatives are designing finance products for smallholder farmers. This is exactly the type of real-world impact that motivates me when building software products!\nZarr Ecosystem Development #Zarr ecosystem development shows Development Seed\u0026rsquo;s commitment to advancing core infrastructure. The work on VirtualiZarr and Zarr v3 directly addresses challenges I faced in oceanography when trying to work with massive climate datasets efficiently. The collaboration with ESA to adopt Zarr for Sentinel missions means analysts can stream only the data they need instead of downloading large zip files.\nObstore #Obstore shows the kind of engineering fundamentals that excite me! The goal is to build a stateless, Rust-backed Python library for object storage access. It might seem like infrastructure work, but it directly impacts python performance when working in cloud-native solution as it enables everything else to run faster and more reliably. The focus on speed, and clarity/interoperability corresponds to the kind of engineering quality I value.\nCloud-Native Data Transformation #Cloud-native data transformation projects like the Spatial Access Lab work demonstrate how modern tools can make public data truly accessible. The project converts Canada\u0026rsquo;s Spatial Access Measures from legacy CSVs to GeoParquet, then builds an entirely browser-based analytical interface using DuckDB-WASM and deck.gl.\neoAPI #eoAPI brings together several state-of-the-art projects to create a complete Earth Observation API framework! The integration of pgSTAC, STAC API, TiTiler, and other components shows the power of combining existing open-source tools into coherent systems. This modular, standards-based approach really matches the way I think about building sustainable infrastructure.\nAll these projects share common threads: they make scientific data more accessible and they build on open standards and open-source tools. In addition, they contribute to environmental monitoring, climate action, and open science. But these projects also face substantial (and interesting!) technical challenges such as working with planetary-scale datasets, building AI systems that remain grounded in scientific rigor, or creating infrastructure that runs efficiently across multiple cloud providers. This combination of technical depth and real-world impact is exactly what attracted me to Development Seed!\nTrue color image of the Earth from space.

That said, there are several technology areas I\u0026rsquo;ll need to learn:\nThe geospatial data ecosystem (STAC, Zarr, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, and libraries like GDAL and rio-tiler) represents new formats and standards for making Earth observation data accessible at scale. Kubernetes in production environments will require moving beyond my ECS experience. Modern AI-driven tools for building natural language interfaces to scientific data represent a different approach from the traditional machine learning models I have deployed previously. Now that I am working for an organisation that is open by default, I have no excuse not to document my learning journey 😄. I\u0026rsquo;ll do this through regular blog posts. I plan to focus them on technical discoveries and challenges encountered. Beyond documenting my own learning, I hope these posts will help others exploring the intersection of scientific computing, geospatial technologies, and modern cloud infrastructure.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/posts/01_joining_development_seed/","section":"Blog","summary":"Excited to announce I\u0026rsquo;m joining Development Seed as a Cloud Engineer to work on geospatial infrastructure for ESA and ECMWF.

My experience in academia certainly helped me in developing a strong mentoring culture.\nCurrent Leadership Practice #In my role at DWP, I lead a team of 2 young engineers while supporting broader organizational capability building:\nMentoring Through Action\nRegular pair programming sessions with team members Hands-on debugging sessions that become teaching moments Supporting career progression by creating development plans that balance immediate needs with long-term growth Knowledge Multiplication\nDeveloped comprehensive onboarding guides reducing new developer setup from days to hours Created reusable Terraform modules and Docker templates that encode best practices Established testing strategies that went from concept to 85% coverage implementation Built internal documentation that serves as both reference and learning material Standards Without Rigidity\nImplemented pre-commit hooks and CI/CD standards that guide rather than constrain Introduced code quality metrics that teams actually find helpful Created bug report templates that streamline problem-solving Some Reflections on Technical Leadership #Learning Through Collaboration: Some of my most valuable moments happen when working alongside my teammates on challenging problems. Those debugging sessions often become mutual learning experiences where we both discover better approaches to error handling and system design.\nFreedom Through Structure: I\u0026rsquo;ve found it interesting how clear technical guidelines can actually increase creativity. When the team doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about formatting or basic quality checks, I think it create more mental space to focus on solving the actual problems at hand.\nFrom Solving to Enabling: I\u0026rsquo;m gradually shifting from \u0026ldquo;I know how to fix this\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How can we build systems so this problem becomes easier for everyone to solve?\u0026rdquo; When I built that Docker Compose environment to allow the team to run integration tests between our web application, graph database, and splunk server, it didn\u0026rsquo;t just solve an immediate problem, it remove a recurring blocker for everyone.\nCurrent Focus Areas # Knowledge Sharing: Contributing to documentation and learning resources for geospatial data engineering Open Source Participation: Engaging with communities building Earth observation infrastructure Cross-Domain Translation: Bridging scientific data processing and cloud-native engineering practices 🎯 Core Competencies #The diagram below shows how I understand my professional development, with Problem Solving as \u0026ldquo;the driving force\u0026rdquo;.\nThe three branches reflect my career evolution: Scientific Thinking from research years where you learn to be systematic and question everything, Engineering Practices developed transitioning to software development, and Team Leadership emerging as I found sharing knowledge often more impactful than individual work. These areas reinforce each other: my research background helps me approach infrastructure methodically, engineering experience makes me a better mentor, and team work drives more systematic thinking.\nThe Continuous Learning foundation feels essential: every role change, technology, or colleague conversation adds to this framework. It\u0026rsquo;s how I approach growth: staying curious, building on what I know, and helping others grow too.\n┌─────────────────┐ │ PROBLEM │ │ SOLVING │ └─────────────────┘ │ ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌───────▼──────┐ ┌───────▼───────┐ ┌──────▼──────┐ │ SCIENTIFIC │────\u0026gt;│ ENGINEERING │────\u0026gt;│ TEAM │ │ THINKING │ │ PRACTICES │ │ LEADERSHIP │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ • Systematic │ │ • Automation │ │ • Mentoring │ │ • Rigorous │ │ • Security │ │ • Pairing │ │ • Data-Driven│ │ • Scalability │ │ • Standards │ └──────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └─────────────┘ ▲ ▲ ▲ └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘ │ ┌───────┴───────┐ │ CONTINUOUS │ │ LEARNING │ └───────────────┘ ","date":"12 November 2025","permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/skills/","section":"Loïc Houpert","summary":"","title":"My Technical Evolution"},{"content":"Example of projects I worked on.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/projects/","section":"Technical Projects","summary":"","title":"Technical Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://lhoupert.fr/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
